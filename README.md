# Virtual Cat

## Introduction
This project is an interactive virtual cat chatbot named Lani that is powered by GPT-3.  I was inspired to create this chatbot as a gift to someone who was missing their cat.

## Code Base
cat.java - is a simple java program that was the initial start prototype

cat.py - is a basic working prototype using GPT-3

## Current Plans
I want to further develop cat.py to be interactive in the command line and support longer conversations.

## Future Plans
I plan to transition the project from GPT-3 to an open source replacement like GPT-Neo or GPT-J.  After that I would like to build a basic website that uses it.  This would make it more accessible to non-developers.
